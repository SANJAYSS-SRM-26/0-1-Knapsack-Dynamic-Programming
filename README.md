# 0/1-Knapsack-Dynamic-Programming
This program implements a dynamic programming solution for the 0-1 Knapsack problem in C.The 0-1 Knapsack problem is a classic optimization problem where given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the maximum value that can be obtained by selecting a subset of the items such that the total weight does not exceed a given limit.

## Time Complexity
Time Complexity is proportional to the size of the 2D array 'K', which is (n+1) * (W+1), resulting in O(n * W) overall time complexity.

## Instructions
1. Compile the program using a C compiler.
2. Run the compiled executable.
3. The program will output the maximum value that can be obtained by selecting items based on their weights and values, subject to a given weight limit.
